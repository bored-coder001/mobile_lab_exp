# Mobile Phone as Free- Rotation Lab

Free Rotation of Mobile phone(I used POCO M2 PRO) which is a rigid body so we use Euler's Equation. 
The instantaneous angular velocity data is collected by Phyphox app which is then compared with theoretical equation by the provided Simulation. 

Overleaf link [here](https://www.overleaf.com/project/60e72e863797bcaf2338ebc0) act as the final report with complete background study, Theory associated and Results and conclusions.

I will type in more info about the project I am still learning and ITS FUN.
